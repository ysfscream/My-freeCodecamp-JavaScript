# My-freeCodecamp-JavaScript

This repository is not for an app or website project where I keep a record of my javascript algorithm practice I have done and I learned form FreeCodeCamp.

[FreeCodeCamp](https://frecodecamp.org) is the best place to learning code, There you can become an amazing Front-end-Developer.

This consists of there parts

  - Basic-Algorithm-Scripting
  - Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
  - Advanced Algorithm Scripting

ðŸ’ª I hope I can finish it well
