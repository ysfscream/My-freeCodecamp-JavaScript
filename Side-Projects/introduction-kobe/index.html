                            <strong>Early life and education</strong>
                            <p>- Bryant was born in Philadelphia, as the youngest of three children and the only son of Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant.[4] He is also the maternal nephew of basketball player John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu.</p>

                            <strong>High school</strong>
                            <p>- Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career at Lower Merion High School located in Ardmore, in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. As a freshman, he played for the varsity basketball team.[13] He became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 4–20 record.[13][14] The following three years, the Aces compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions.</p>

                            <strong>1996 NBA draft</strong>
                            <p>- The first guard to ever be taken out of high school, Bryant was chosen as the 13th overall draft pick by the Charlotte Hornets in 1996.[26] According to Arn Tellem, Bryant's agent at the time, Bryant playing for the Charlotte Hornets was "an impossibility".[27] However, Bill Branch, the Hornets' head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their draft selection to the Los Angeles Lakers before picking Bryant. </p>
